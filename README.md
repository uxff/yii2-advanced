坑总结：
1 git 提交每次需要密码：
	http://blog.chinaunix.net/uid-26359455-id-3223565.html
	1.1 # ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "xxx@gmail.com"
	1.2 将.ssh/id_rsa.pub拷贝到GitHub网站
	1.3 # eval `ssh-agent`
	1.4 # ssh-add
	（输入passphrase）(本次没执行1.4)
	1.5 测试是否联通
	    # ssh git@github.com
	1.6 如果有origin或origin is already exist
	    # git remote rm origin
	    # git remote add origin uxff@github.com:uxff/yii2-advanved.git
	1.7 接下来推送使用# git push origin master 而不是# git push -u origin master
